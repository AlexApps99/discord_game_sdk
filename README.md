# discord_game_sdk

Safe wrapper for the [Discord Game SDK](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide).

## Status

This library is currently in very early stages, most of the API is missing.

## "Legal" note

This wrapper was informally allowed for publication and distribution by Discord Staff.
I cannot redistribute the SDK files until it is made open-source or is licensed for redistribution. You will have to follow some instructions when first setting up your project.
If you're a part of Discord and wish to discuss this, please email `ldesgoui@gmail.com` or contact `twiikuu#0047`. I mean no harm.
